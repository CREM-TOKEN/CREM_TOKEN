# $CREM – Coreum Token

**Coreum ($CREM)** is a fully autonomous, deflationary token on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by Bitcoin’s fixed supply and trustless mechanics, $CREM runs on pure code — with zero developer control after launch.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Total Supply:** 21,000,000 $CREM
- **Immutable:** No minting, no upgradability, no dev wallet
- **Burn Logic:** 5% of every *sell* is burned automatically until total supply hits 3,000,000
- **Final Form:** Once 3M supply is reached, no more burns. Token becomes fixed forever
- **No Tax on Buys** – Only sells are penalized
- **Sniper Bot Protection**, **Anti-Whale**, and **Cooldown Logic** built-in

## ⚙️ Philosophy

> Code is law. Supply is king. Scarcity is truth.  
Once deployed, $CREM is unstoppable. No admin keys. No rug switches. Just a deflationary machine engineered for long-term community trust and value.
